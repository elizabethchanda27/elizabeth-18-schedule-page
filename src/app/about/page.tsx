                Pearl Hacks was first held in 2014 as one of the only
                beginner-friendly hackathons targeted towards women at the time.
                It was organized in response to the boom in college hackathons,
                where students got to spend a weekend bringing their
                technological ideas to life with the help of their peers and
                industry professionals.

                But while those hackathons were great at immersing students into
                tech, it was clear that the gender gap and the often
                intimidating environment at those events was stopping a lot of
                women of all skill levels from signing up. The first Pearl
                Hacks, organized by UNC alumni Maegan Clawges, brought in 250
                female high school and college students in the hopes of
                providing them with a great hackathon experience that
                sidestepped these issues.

                By growing and learning from the last eight years of Pearl Hacks
                (which has nearly tripled in size), we now strive to be an open
                and inclusive environment for gender minorities to experience
                hackathons, and hopefully dive deeper into the world of
                technology after experiencing a weekend with us.
